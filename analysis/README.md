# BDQC
Big Data Quality Control Analysis Component

This component uses the signatures (.bdqc JSON objects) of many files to calculate models of what
seems like normal, and then identify outliers that do not meet the expectation of normal based
on their deviation from the model of normal.

See doc/BDQC_TestNotes.txt for some examples.
