Prioritized to do list:

- The XML plugin is fragile to imperfect XML. Needs to be made robust in the face of bad input. Maybe custom
- Make sure that .html files don't choke the xml plugin
- Try to fix the file extension handling section better. Better to use extensions where possible rather than empirical
- Check out the tsvs in the Papers directory and see if the tsv detector needs improvement
- Think about how to adjust models so that long tails don't trigger outliers so easily

- Expand the documentation

- Add option to import just models from the .models file
- Add option to compare new files (and their signatures) to existing models
- Start testing with a wider range of files on the computer
- There is a rumor that sometimes txt files will trigger Tabular and sometimes not for similar files, causing a problem

- Package up as a nice Perl module
- Design and write a series of Perl t/ tests


- Create a template program that is quite simple as an example for a model creator
- Add ability to override Models to an external program
- Split the Scalar model into String and Number
- change the Array model to be order-dependent somehow?
- Change the Array model to be just sensitive to membership of items? Isn't it already? Test!

- Is is possible to separate the length and avg ASCII into two numbers instead of one?
- Work on some more testDistributions
-
